# Tutorial Introduction

The goal of the tutorial is to provide an example driven explanation of the language to hit the ground running quickly. The [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) should be reviewed for a more definite and technically correct explanation of any concept, symbol, operator, or facet of the language. Additionally we have a list of recommended books for both [beginner programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_beginners/) and [experienced programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_programmers/).

So far the only sections of the tutorial written are those on:

- [Recommended Books for Begineers](/docs/tutorial/for_beginners/)
- [Recommended Reading for Experienced Programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_programmers/)
- [Macros](/docs/tutorial/macros)
- [Long Tutorial on Packages](/docs/tutorial/projects/guide_to_packages)
- [Short Guide to Packages](/docs/tutorial/projects/packages-systems)
- [Tutorial on Structuring Projects](/docs/tutorial/projects/)
