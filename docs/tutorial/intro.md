# Tutorial Introduction

The goal of the tutorial is to provide an example driven explanation of the language to hit the ground running quickly. The [Technical Reference](https://lisp-docs.github.io/cl-language-reference/) should be reviewed for a more definite and technically correct explanation of any concept, symbol, operator, or facet of the language. Additionally we have a list of recommended books for both [beginner programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_beginners/) and [experienced programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_programmers/).

<!-- So far the only sections of the tutorial written are those on:

- [Recommended Books for Begineers](/docs/tutorial/for_beginners/)
- [Recommended Reading for Experienced Programmers](/docs/tutorial/for_programmers/)
- [Macros](/docs/tutorial/macros)
- [Long Tutorial on Packages](/docs/tutorial/projects/guide_to_packages)
- [Short Guide to Packages](/docs/tutorial/projects/packages-systems)
- [Tutorial on Structuring Projects](/docs/tutorial/projects/) -->

Most of the tutorial is written. However, it needs to be checked for correctness. With that said, most of it is correct and should get you to be ready to go and dig deeper in other resources.
