If you just tried to USE-PACKAGE both P1 and P2 you would get a name conflict because Lisp would have no way of knowing whether X in MYPACKAGE should now be P1",":X"," or P2",":X",". To resolve such name conflicts every package maintains what is called a shadowing symbols list. The shadowing symbols list is a list of symbols that shadow or override any symbols would normally become visible in that package as a result of calling USE-PACKAGE. There are two ways to add symbols to a package\u2019s shadowing symbols list, SHADOW and SHADOWING-IMPORT. SHADOW is used to add symbols that are in the package to the shadowing symbols list.
